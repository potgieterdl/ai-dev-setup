Read the prd from .taskmaster/docs/prd.md to understand the overall project we are working on. We have now implemented all tasks, get a list of all parent tasks and then do a full audit of the application. take a look at the previous git commit to understand the last change and improvement done. Consider this and then see if any final changes are needed to ensure we have a working application. Test it end-to-end to make sure its functional and fix any issues that you find. You are in headless mode and no user imput can be requested, when in doubt, see if the tasks align with the PRD and make a decisive choice. Any decisions should be documented using an ADR (Architectural Design Record) in the adr folder with the feature number for reference. Once done, Prettier formatting all code, do a build and test to ensure its all working. Create a git message with appropriate information to capture the task completed (e.g. FEATURE 1 - xxxx) and a summary of what was done in a human readable way. Then commit this code and push to origin. Only address high and medium issues.
