Read the top 70 lines from .taskmaster/docs/prd.md to understand the overall project we are working on. The rest of the PRD has sections with details which you can refer to when needed using the TOC naming scheme to grep for it like "F4: MCP Server Configuration" which will return the TOC entry and then the line that has the section you need to read. Get the next task to work on, understand the task before and its dependencies. Once you have this view, expand the task (no research needed) and start its implementation by working through each subtask. Once done, do a build and test to ensure its all working. Create a git message with appropriate information to capture the task completed (e.g. FEATURE 1 - xxxx) and a summary of what was done in a human readable way. Then commit this code
