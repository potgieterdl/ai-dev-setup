You are working on {{PROJECT_NAME}}.

## Context

- Read `docs/prd.md` for what we're building
- Read `docs/architecture.md` for system design
- Check `docs/adr/` for past architectural decisions
- Follow conventions in `.claude/rules/` — they auto-load based on file paths

## Task Tracker: {{TASK_TRACKER}}

Use the configured task tracker to find, implement, and complete tasks.
Run the next-task command to pick up work.

## Quality Gate

Every commit must pass: format → lint → type-check → build → test.
The pre-commit hook enforces this automatically.

## Key Commands

- `/dev-next` — Pick up and implement the next task
- `/review` — Review current changes against project rules
