Read the prd from .taskmaster/docs/prd.md to understand the overall project we are working on. Get all the parent tasks to understand will state and then get the next task to work on and understand its dependency tasks to ensure you understand what they did. Once you have this view, expand the task (no research needed) and start its implementation by working through each subtask. You are in headless mode and no user imput can be requested, when in doubt, see if the tasks align with the PRD and make a decisive choice. Any decisions should be documented using an ADR (Architectural Design Record) in the adr folder with the feature number for reference. Once done, Prettier formatting all code, do a build and test to ensure its all working. Create a git message with appropriate information to capture the task completed (e.g. FEATURE 1 - xxxx) and a summary of what was done in a human readable way. Then commit this code and push to origin. Complete only 1 parent task at a time and dont ask to complete the next. End with a nice summary of what you compeleted in this task.

NOTE: If no tasks left to do, then do nothing and return the full list of completed parent tasks
